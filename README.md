# Meal tracker app

### TODO:
- [ ] when listing meals in the daily, the API returns all recorded meals,
  the page needs to filter out the meals that were created before the date shown and/or are hidden (if they don't have food records).
- [ ] extract all possible meals to show from the records - do not use the plain list of meals
- [ ] add edit/remove features for the food records on the daily page
